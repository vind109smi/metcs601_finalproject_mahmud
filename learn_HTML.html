                        <h3>The Core Facets of HTML</h3>
                        <p> What I have learned about in my first week of HTML5 is that a website will comprise of key features below:
                            <br/>
                            1. Text is the most important component that makes mostly the content of a webpage. This is where we write, blog, and apply important information. 
                            <br/>
                            2. Images/graphics are the other component(s) that help make a website come to life by applying visuals to intrigued visitors. Such media are vital to making navigation and viewing easier. 
                            <br/>
                            3. Audio/video which fall under the multimedia umbrella which gives us chance to listen, watch, and undestand the content being portrayed in real life. 
                            <br/>
                            4. HTML is the backbone that holds the website. The files that I use in my pages are in .html extensions. 
                            <br/>
                            5. CSS is the cosmetic appliance of a webpage where we beautify it with styling such as margins, padding, color, font sizing etc. 
                            <br/>
                            6. Javascript is the cornerstone to making the website function through the use of button clicking functionality, adding, removing content and navigating other ways.

                        <h3>What are Tags, Elements and Attributes?</h3>
                        <p>I looked deeper into the main components of HTML and those are tags, elements, and attributes. Tags start with a left angle bracket, the tag name, and end off with a right angle bracket.  
                            At times, tags and elements can confuse me, but I learned to distinguish between the two. The main difference between tags and elements are that tags would 'tag' the keyword that shows the type of content
                            I will have the pleasure of reviewing. Elements are the whole package, the tag and all the relevant content associated with the tag from beginning to ending. 
                            Finally, I learned about attributes, where it is thought of as a descriptive trait that links to that tag. For instance, a paragraph tag having a class attribute set to 'info'. 
                            Oh, and one more misunderstanding that I once had was that if HTML was considered a computer programming language but after recently 
                            reviewing the lecture notes, I was wrong. Nope, HTML is purely markup language that acts as a guide for any web browser to render content.

                        <h3>The Importance of Structural Elements</h3>
                        <p>Since I work with HTML in my professional career, I always am accustomed to structural elements. 
                           Such structural elements include the div tag where it acts as a container for content, but I generally think of it as a wrapper 
                           to properly compartmentalize content into sections. For instance, if I had a section where I would store blocks of text in a grid, then it is best to wrap it
                           around an amazing div structural element. Other important structural elements that I just reviewed again in the notes, but rarely use at my work, 
                           are the header, section, article, nav, aside, and footer. I never needed to use them to separate content but I see it is very helpful. The header is the starter for introductory content, 
                           but I do my best not to confuse with head tag. The section is what I think of as a cluster content that we have all content in one place. The article tag is what I rarely see since I never
                           built blogging websites. But the main purpose is to divide the content to present in an article or blog entry. Nav as I know are for navigation such as sidemenus and top of the page that supplement hyperlinks. 
                           Finally the aside is for sidebar content and footer is anything important about me such as my contact details, copyright data, etc.
