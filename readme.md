Content: Final Project about Me
Course: MET CS 601 Web App Development

1.Purpose of This Project:
This project will allow me the opportunity to take what I have learned in this course overall such as learning the core topics: HTML5, CSS3, JS, JSON, Fetch, and Vue. By utlilzing these technologies, I want to build a professional porfolio of myself where I describe who I am, what I do, what is my educational and work experience and how I can use certain techniques to refine my webpage.

2.Use of This Project
This project will help not only me but my peers and others appreciate my work and see how much experience I have building a professional website. This will help me in future careers whenever I apply and my future employers will look at it and be amazed by my work. I am keeping in mind of the styling, navigational consistency, padding, and other things, but especially accessibility. I want those who have sight impairments such as color blindness to easily read my text and focus on the background color.

3.How To Run This Project
Once all HTML files have been code completed, or development done, for e.g, say you run this code in Visual Studio Code, ensure you have the right extension. It would be Open with Browser by TechR extension which will allow you to run the .html files on default browser of choice. I chose Firefox. Once the extension is installed, right click on either the html files on your Project Explorer window or inside the file's text editor window. Then you select Open In Default Browser and a separate window will pop up. If all works fine, you should see your first web page in your default browser, in this case, Firefox. 
This project will be uploaded to a live server so prior to that, please ensure this is testable in the local browser or Live Server before uploading to a server. I am planning to host this via glitch. So in order for me to do this, I am syncing this project to a github repo. First, we initialize the repo, commit our files (making sure they can be tracked), then this will take it to the local folder, then commit and push is a direct push to the server. We do this once we set our repo and link to our personal GitHub account. My account project URL: https://github.com/vind109smi/metcs601-mahmud-finalproject for instance.


4.Getting Help with this Project
Various sources for learning about the HTML5 content can either be found on my 'Learn More About HTML5' link once you open this project (just click the navigation link that says it) and you can read about it. Or you can visit various websites such as Tutorialspoint, W3Schools, etc. or Github repo on HTML5 info and source code.
